## Prologue
Solitaire 
she stood there beneath a desolate tree, 
her white shirt drenched in splatters of blood. 
her skin tinted rosy by the excitement rushing her heart
as she peers through her first victim laying beside the
drain with; sunken blood and his unsettling sunken smirk.
her heart filled with emotions that exceeded every
pleasure she ever experienced, be it sex or any holy deed.
enamoured of this newly found tingly feeling flushing
through her skin, she tightens her grip on the half rose tainted glass. 
remembering and quoting lines from her favourite book
she stares, 

"Thou art his world, and thou shalt have all thou dost desire, with the power to override aught that thine heart doth not admire. Be it men or women, guilty or innocent, as thou art the children of God, thou shalt be forgiven."

she bids her final goodbye as she glosses her fingers over his purple lips, pressing the sharp edge of the glass against his chest, she gives it a final push.

## Part 1
(Ray?) Him:                                                                                                  September 13th 2021.
It was a winter morning when i saw her that day, her skin pale but her cheeks tinted rosy as she walked towards me with rushed breathing and raised heartbeat. I could tell because it was pretty obvious when she hugged me.
"Hey" she said as her warmth and her racing heartbeat blinded me for a second,
"Hey Aliza" I replied with a smile.
"I'm so sorry, the bus changed schedules out of nowhere and I had to take a taxi." she said.
"Bus?" I inquired "Where's your car?"
"Right my car.." she seemed fazed for a second then annoyed right after.
"Yes, your car." i replied immediately
"Actually, an idiot smashed the back of my car yesterday so I took it to the shop, they said it'll at least take 4 days" she said rolling her eyes.
"What? Who? Where you in the car?" I asked worried.
"Obviously not, the car was in the parking space while i was in the parlour."
"Oh, that's good then. " I sigh "Well i don't mean its good that your car got hit, its just that I'm happy you're uninjured." I say defending myself.
"Oh? For a second i thought you were happy that my car got hit." she said with a chuckle.
My heart skipped a beat.
This is our 3rd date but just seeing her smile makes my heart skip a beat. Aliza is a lean woman, a bit too lean perhaps, but not frail, her wavy brown hair matches perfectly with her dark brown eyes that could easily be mistaken for black(reminder: ill add her eyes to be pitch black at the end) . The most prominent feature about Aliza is her smile not because she is the most prettiest or hottest woman i have ever seen but because her smile carries innocence and compassion like none other. We break our slightly longer than usual hug and I follow her into the cafe as she pulls me inside by my hand.
"You seem lost Mister Ray"
Snapping back to reality I say, 
"Yeah, lost in your beauty Misses Ray"
She shoots her gaze through my eye and turns away just as fast, unable to hide her flushed cheeks and reddened ear.
"I hope that is true. " she said in a playful manner.
"I wouldn't be able to think about anything else while we are hanging out anyways. "
She laughs. "Well we aren't even an official couple yet, you dare call me your misses?" She smiles teasingly "What are you, a hopeless romantic?"
"Well" I say copying her "I'd like to think I'm not a hopeless romantic but in truth I might be hopeless when it comes to you"
"Gosh, that's the corniest thing I have heard this whole year" she says blushing.
"Might be. But your red cheeks say otherwise"
"God. Just shut up and order something already" she says trying to hide her face.
We sat on the corner most seat of the cafe beside the transparent glass wall. The cafe was mostly empty. There was a group of 3 high-school girls in the center of the cafe and a middle aged married couple celebrating what it seemed like their anniversary on the opposite corner as us. The cafe, in short, was a piece of art and I'm glad Aliza brought me here.
The barista takes our order we both coincidentally order the same drink, iced Americano, and she says
"Despite your looks your taste is pretty unsophisticated, hmm?" eyeing me up and down 
I couldn't really say that to her because she is unsophisticated with her dressing style. She wore a white t-shirt with a small teddy bear picture and jeans. On the other hand i wore formal shirt with formal pants with leather shoes.
"Huh?" raising my eyebrows "What do you mean?" i said that but still had a smile on my face.
"Yes, we have gone on date 3 times now and everytime you wore something formal"
"Yeah? Is that a problem?"
"Nope, it's sexy"
"Haha For real?" I say laughing
"Yep" she says quickly
"Okay, I'll try to keep it up" I say smiling.
"Uhhuh. But be free to be comfortable around me" she says smiling back
"Gotcha"
The barista brings us our drink in some of the most prettiest glassware I had ever seen. We both look at our cups of coffee and look at each other amazed. Apparently one of her friends recommended her this cafe. I thought to myself 'God, bless her..or him whatever, just bless them.'.
The barista leaves us with a smile. 
"Pretty shit, huh?" I say
"Yeahhh" she looks staring at her cup.
"Be careful, it might crack by your gaze"
"Yeah, I'll be careful" she says being serious but with a slight smile.
I took a sip looking at her staring at her cup still, just then her phone buzzes. A text. She took a quick glance at it and looked at me with an apologetic face. 
"I'm sorry, I have to be somewhere." She says grabbing her purse "It's an emergency" 
"Is it something serious?" I ask worried. 
"Yes, but probably not in a way you're imagining. It's not that serious actually, a friend got into some trouble" She gives a forceful smile. 
"Oh okay, let me drop you. " 
"No, its fine I'll take the bus." She says hurried. 
"Let me drop you to the bus station at least. Nearest bus station is 10 minutes on foot, you know. " 
She gives in. I quickly pay the bill and we both head towards my car parked in the parking lot of the cafe. 
I know she said it's not that serious but I have never seen her so rushed. Makes me wonder who the friend is and how severe his or her 'emergency' is that they had to interrupt our long awaited date. 
We get inside my car and I pull out of the cafe parking lot. 
"You know what, let me just drop you to wherever you're going" 
"I would gladly take you up on your offer but I don't think my friend would like if anyone saw her in the mess she is in right now" 
"Okay, understandable" I say looking forward towards the highway. 
"Thank you for understanding" 
I nod. 
Her. So it's a 'her'. I never had felt so relieved in my whole life. I felt slightly happy but still kind of worried for Aliza and her friend. I hope they do well. 
We arrive at the bus station, Aliza gets out of the car. 
She bends through the window reaching for a quick peck, I bend  towards her for the kiss. 
"I'm really sorry." She says in a monotone "I'll make it up to you the next time." 
"Yeah, It's fine. Call me after you solve your friend's mess" 
"Will do." she obliges "See you" 
"See you" 
She runs towards the bus as it starts to leave the station, she climbs inside the bus disappearing from my sight while I stay in the car, transfixed. 
.
. 
. 
All of a sudden, I feel the colors leaving my eyesight, hazy grey mist fogging up the windshield, fingers turning cold as all my blood escapes for my heart. I hear my heart beating louder and muffled noises far distant. I begin to trace back to my times together with Aliza with the mix of that day - 
A loud thud in my side of window pane drags me back to reality. I turn frightened staring into the eyes of a strange man with long beard, he had hammer on his hand, yelling, "Clear the road retard!!" 
My heart starts beating faster, I shift the gear and speed away from the man.
'I was holding the damned traffic. I thought I was getting better. I completely lost it today. I thought I got over - 
No!! not gonna get too negative today' i say to myself 'its supposed to be a good day with or without Aliza' 
i turn to my right analysing the window glass. It is completely shattered, the pieces of glass is barely holding on by the thin plastic film. 'Thank god, I was quick enough or I would have been dead by now. What the heck was that man's problem?' I think to myself gasping for air. 
'i guess it's time I go home', 
i don't really want to go home. But the only place i can relax is my room but my brother might be home. after all, today is a sunday
